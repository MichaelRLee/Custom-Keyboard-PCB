# Lee Keyboard PCBs

Open source, hot-swappable board PCBs designed to be controlled by commonly available microcontroller boards (Pro Micro for the numpad, and Teensy LC, 3.2, etc. for the TKL).  These could easily be swapped out for any other board, but the qmk firmware would need to be modified for the specific controller.
